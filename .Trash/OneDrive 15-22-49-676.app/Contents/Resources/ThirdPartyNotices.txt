PCRE

    PCRE LICENCE
    ------------

    PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
    and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

    Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
    specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
    directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The data
    in the testdata directory is not copyrighted and is in the public domain.

    The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
    included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
    just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
    are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

    ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
    sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
    ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
    by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
    that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
    ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
    of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
    the foregoing paragraphs do.

    The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
    It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
    The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
    ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
    but is also freely distributable.

    The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
    To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
    been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
    "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
    resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
    GIF decoders.

LIBFREETYPE

                        The FreeType Project LICENSE
                        ----------------------------

                                2006-Jan-27

                        Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
              David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg



    Introduction
    ============

      The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
      some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
      various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
      FreeType Project.

      This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
      which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
      affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
      documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

      This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
      (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
      and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
      alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

        o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
          interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

        o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
          full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

        o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
          it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
          somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
          FreeType code. (`credits')

      We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
      software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
      We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
      assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.


      Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
      credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
      encourage you to use the following text:

       """
        Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
        Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
       """

      Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
      actually use.


    Legal Terms
    ===========

    0. Definitions
    --------------

      Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
      and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
      distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
      Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
      beta or final release.

      `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
      `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
      code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
      This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
      engine'.

      This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
      FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
      documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
      original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
      If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
      this license, you must contact us to verify this.

      The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
      Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
      specified below.

    1. No Warranty
    --------------

      THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
      KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
      WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
      BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
      USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

    2. Redistribution
    -----------------

      This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
      irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
      display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
      sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
      forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
      authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
      herein, subject to the following conditions:

        o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
          (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
          the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
          documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
          original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
          files.

        o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
          states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
          FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
          encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
          documentation, though this isn't mandatory.

      These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
      the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
      our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
      to us.

    3. Advertising
    --------------

      Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
      the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
      purposes without specific prior written permission.

      We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
      following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
      or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
      `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

      As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
      accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
      material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
      authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
      Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
      Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
      of this license.

    4. Contacts
    -----------

      There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:

        o freetype@nongnu.org

          Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
          future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
          If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
          haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.

        o freetype-devel@nongnu.org

    The following is a list of all copyright notices and license statements which
    appear in the xkbcommon source tree.

    If making new contributions, the first form (i.e. Daniel Stone, Ran Benita,
    etc) is vastly preferred.

    All licenses are derivative of the MIT/X11 license, mostly identical other
    than no-endorsement clauses (e.g. paragraph 4 of The Open Group's license).

    These statements are split into two sections: one for the code compiled and
    distributed as part of the libxkbcommon shared library and the code
    component of all tests (i.e. everything under src/ and xkbcommon/, plus the
    .c and .h files under test/), and another for the test data under test/data,
    which is distributed with the xkbcommon source tarball, but not installed to
    the system.

    Copyright 2014 Dropbox, Inc.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1.Definitions.

        "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and
        distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including
        but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
        translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code,
        generated documentation, and conversions to other media types.

        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
        available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included
        in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
        based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
        elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
        For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain 
        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and 
        Derivative Works thereof.

        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version 
        of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works 
        thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work 
        by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit
        on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
        means any form of electronic,verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor
        or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
        mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
        managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
        improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
        otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
        of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated
        within the Work.


      2.Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, 
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
      Works in Source or Object form.


      3.Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
      each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
      license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
      transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone
      or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s)
      was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
      incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
      then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
      terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.


      4.Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
      Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
      form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

        (a)You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
        License; and

        (b)You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
        changed the files; and

        (c)You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
        all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of
        the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
        Works; and

        (d)If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
        Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
        notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain
        to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
        NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
        by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
        The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify
        the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
        distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
        such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
        distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies 
        with the conditions stated in this License.


      5.Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
      intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under
      the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any
      separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.


      6.Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
      service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
      customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.


      7.Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
      Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an
      "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,
      including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
      MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
      determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
      associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.


      8.Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
      (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
      (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
      Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
      License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited
      to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
      or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
      been advised of the possibility of such damages.


      9.Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance
      of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
      consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act
      only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
      Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
      harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor
      by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
