OneDrive Files On-Demand helps you access all your files in OneDrive without having to download all of them and use storage space on your device. New files created online or on another device appear as online-only files, which don't take up space on your device. When you're connected to the Internet, you'll be able to use the files like every other file on your device.\nTo use Files On-Demand, you will need to be running the latest macOS Mojave (10.14.2 or higher). You can enable Files On-Demand in the general tab of OneDrive's preferences menu.";
